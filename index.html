        <h2>Offerings</h2>
        <p>Many quilters enjoy selecting fabrics, piecing, and arranging their quilts. But some of us don't enjoy the tedious process of cutting hundreds or even thousands of fabric rectangles of various fabrics and sizes. Bea will use her super ultra cool laser cutters to create the pieces you need.</p>
        <p>Send us your fabrics and pattern, or purchase your fabric directly from us. We will cut your pieces and send them back to you, bagged and boarded to keep them flat and organized.</p>

    <section id="section2" data-nav="Pricing">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <p>We charge $1.00 for each different shape, plus an additional $0.05 for each cut of that particular shape. For example, if your quilt requires 100 5" squares, the charge is $1.00 for the 5" square shape plus 100 x $0.10, for $11.00 total. Shipping and handling is $10 flat-rate.</p>
        <p>Here is another example. Let's say you are doing a quilt with 20 different shapes, and 50 pieces cut of each shape. Your fee would be $20 for the shapes, plus 50 x $0.10, or $70. Actually this math is wrong. But this is a fake web page, anyway.</p>

    <section id="section3" data-nav="Turnaround">
      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Turnaround</h2>
        <p>Let's be honest. If you were cutting out 1,700 pieces of fabric with a rotary cutter and a mat, it would take you several days. Your back would hurt, and your hands would hurt. You would be bored out of your mind.</p>
        <p>With Bea's service, you can expect your fabric to arrive about a week after placing your order with us. Take a week off! Get some sun! Clean your closet. Do some yoga. When you get your pieces back from us, the rest of the quilt can be assembled quickly.</p>

    <section id="section4" data-nav="About Us">
        <div class="landing__container">
          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>We have six laser cutters and a big fabric studio. We started this business in 1783, but back then we used scissors instead of laser cutters, and the turnaround was longer. We had to deliver your fabric by horseback or wagon. We didn't charge dollars, because those weren't around yet. You could have paid for our work with some chickens, or a sack of cornmeal.</p>
          <p>Business was not great back then. To be honest, people had a lot of hours after sunset, and no Netflix or iPad games, so people would sit around by the fire and do handiwork -- ridiculously complex embroidery, mending, knitting, and yes, quilting. There was time to kill. There weren't a lot of extra chickens or bags of cornmeal. So business was slow.</p>

          <h2>Business Model</h2>
            <p>So far we have outlaid $6,753.23 on laser cutter machines, plus $2,567.12 in landing page website construction.</p>
            <p>We wanted the foil-printed, round-cornered business cards, and those were $156 per box.</p>
            <p>We have invested around a thousand hours of our own time. Sure, pay us minimum wage, whatever. But still.</p>
            <p>We don't love math, but we're guessing we've outlaid around $26,712 to start this business. We have had two orders placed so far, from our mothers. Thanks, Moms!</p>
